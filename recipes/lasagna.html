        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <h3>Bolognese Sauce</h3>

            <li>In a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil.
                Cook beef and pork, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 6 minutes.
                Drain excess fat.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste to pot and cook, stirring, until incorporated, about 1 minute.
                Add marinara sauce and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then stir in 1 teaspoon salt.
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have melded, about 20 minutes; season with remaining 1 teaspoon salt, if needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Béchamel Sauce</h3>
            
            <li>In a medium pot over medium heat, heat milk until warm to the touch but not boiling.</li>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, melt butter. Add flour and cook, whisking frequently, until light tan in color and texture resembles wet sand, about 2 minutes.
                Whisking constantly, very slowly add milk until combined. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook, whisking constantly, until sauce is thickened and smooth, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pass spoon through edges of pot to collect any butter-flour mixture that wasn’t fully incorporated and mix to combine. Stir in nutmeg; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Assembly</h3>

            <li>Preheat oven to 350°. 
                In a deep 13" x 9" ceramic, glass, or metal baking dish, spread 1 1/2 cups Bolognese, followed by 3 pasta sheets and 3/4 cup béchamel. Sprinkle with about one-fifth of mozzarella and Parmesan.
                Repeat to make 5 layers, finishing with cheese.</li>
            <li>Spray a sheet of foil with cooking spray. Cover dish greased side down.</li>
            <li>Bake lasagna 20 minutes, then increase oven temperature to 400°. 
                Uncover and continue to bake until sides are bubbling and darkened and cheese starts to turn golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn broiler to medium. Broil lasagna, watching closely, until top is browned in spots, about 1 minute. </li>
            <li>Let cool for 15 minutes. Top with parsley.</li>
        </ol>
